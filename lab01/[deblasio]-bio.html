    <body>
    I am an advertising major with a creative emphasis in art direction and design. I am a Fulbright Undergraduate Scholar who studied film at the University of Birmingham in England two summers ago. I am currently a freelance photography ambassador for a cell phone case company called Lifeproof and a ski company called Siroko based out of Spain. I love to ski and surf and while I do these things I take pictures. Photography and film are big hobbies of mine.
